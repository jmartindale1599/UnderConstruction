### Developer's Note
Working on **Under Construction** was an enjoyable journey. If I were to revisit this concept, I'd explore turning it into an isometric game (similar to *The Sims*), where players could purchase and place items in their home, only to see it later destoyed by natural disasters as originally envisioned.
